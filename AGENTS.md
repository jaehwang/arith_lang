## Directory-Specific AGENTS.md Files

* **Always check for `AGENTS.md` files in specific directories** before working on code within them. These files contain targeted context.
* If a directory's `AGENTS.md` is outdated or incorrect, **update it**.
* If you make significant changes to a directory's structure, patterns, or critical implementation details, **document these in its `AGENTS.md`**.
* If a directory lacks a `AGENTS.md` but contains complex logic or patterns worth documenting for AI/humans, **suggest creating one**.
